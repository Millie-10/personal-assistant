# personal-assistant
A smart personal assistant built with n8n. It responds to audio, texts and analyzes images.

## 🚀 What It Can Do

This assistant is more than a chatbot. It’s a multi-functional digital partner that can:

- 💬 **Respond to text messages** with contextual replies
- 🎙️ **Process voice notes** and convert them to text then responds using a voice note.
- 🖼️ **Handle image uploads** analyzes images, extracts texts from images and answers questions about the image.
- 🌐 **Search the web** and return relevant summaries or links
- 📧 **Read and send emails** via Gmail integration
- 📅 **Create and retrieve calendar events** using Google Calendar
- 🧠 **Generate intelligent responses** using OpenAI or Gemini

## 🧠 How It Works

- **Trigger**: Telegram node listens for incoming messages
- **Routing**: Conditional logic determines message type (text, audio, image)
- **Processing**:
- Text → AI response or command execution
- Audio → Speech-to-text → AI or logic
- Image → Metadata analysis or storage
- **Productivity Tools**:
- Email and calendar nodes handle scheduling, reminders, and communication
- Web search node fetches real-time info
- **Response**: All outputs are sent back to Telegram in real time
